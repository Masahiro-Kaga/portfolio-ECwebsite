# Capstone 3 Requirements
### Capstone Objective

At the end of the capstone period, the students are expected to:
- integrate the frontend (React.js) with the backend (Express.js API) then deploy the app to Heroku.
<br><br>
# Main Requirements

### In your backend (Capstone 2):
- In your E-commerce API, add a route to get your user's details.  
- In your E-commerce API, add a route to get all products (active/inactive), admin only.
<br><br>

### Create the necessary backend integration using the fetch() function to the following pages:

- [ ]  Login

- [ ]  Register
- [ ]  Add Product
- [ ]  Enable Product
- [ ]  Disable Product
- [ ]  View Active Products (Regular and Guests)
- [ ]  Admin Dashboard (All Products view)
<br><br>
### Write the necessary component states and form input bindings for every form found in the React.js app.
- [ ]  Login
- [ ]  Register
- [ ]  Add Product
<br><br>

- If Add Product page components are accessed by a regular user, the app must redirect back to the Login page component.
- If the Login and Register page components are accessed while there is a logged in user, the app must redirect to the Home page component.
- Customized and Personalized (Do not simply copy sample and demo).
